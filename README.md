# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The following analysis helps us to find the overall percentages of the passing students compared to the budget per student. The test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School were missing. All the scores from the high school were considered and we made sure the missing vaues didnt affect overall numbers.

## Results

* How is the school summary affected?
  
  The over all passing for Thomas High School came to 90.94% in pycityschools while the 9th graders had the overall passing reduced by 0.3 %.
 
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  
  It didn't affect the reading or math scores. The reason of not including the 9th grade scores is that it can bring down the test scores of the school.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  
  * Math and reading scores by grade : The difference was the Nan showed in 9th graders scores.
  * Scores by school spending : As the 9th graders were nullified, the scores stayed identical.
  * Scores by school size : The Overall passing percentage didn't change.
  * Scores by school type : There was no change.
